# The hCloud Project

This project is a fork of Facebook's Open Compute Project - We would be working more on the datacenter specifications, in order to make them even better!

For more details, please visit http://opencompute.org/

Further, we would also be working on figuring out what sort of software infrastructure would work best on such a platform - that means we would be evaluating Eucalyptus, AppScale, and even hypervisors such as Microsoft Hyper-V and Vmware Server.

Maybe even a custom software platform, with a stripped down version of Linux running the .NET stack. 

Please feel free to join this project, or contact us with your views - thewebmobileinc@gmail.com
